        "answer": "   <p>These are fundamentally different platforms. There are 'everything for everyone' and specialized ones. Instagram and Telegram have a general audience that consumes visual or text content. Shuffle has users who specifically observe the life of a metropolis, where places and events is the main content. Large services do not have any specific specialized tools, while Shuffle has everything to work with events.</p>"
